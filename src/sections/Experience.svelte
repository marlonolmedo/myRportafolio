                            I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive online application inspired by ERP systems, utilizing the Laravel 
                            framework for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, integrating multiple systems into one cohesive 
                            platform. I led an analysis team, conceptualizing and implementing innovative system components while ensuring adherence to the 
                            SCRUM framework by leading daily scrums and scheduling sprint planning sessions. I facilitated seamless data sharing between two 
                            distinct business systems through the provision of Java and Python endpoints, resolving a decade-long issue. I created development 
                            environments for my team using Docker images and Vagrant with VirtualBox, subsequently handing them over to the DevOps team for production 
                            setup. Additionally, I maintained code quality through rigorous testing procedures for both my code and my team's code before deployment.
